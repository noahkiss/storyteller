<objective>
Update ROADMAP.md Phase 1 success criterion #5 to accurately reflect Phase 1's actual delivery (prioritized tier truncation) vs. the aspirational multi-level compression that is Phase 3 work.

Purpose: Gap 2 from VERIFICATION.md — the user confirmed multi-level compression is Phase 3 scope. The success criterion text should match what Phase 1 delivers to avoid permanent verification failure.

Output: Updated ROADMAP.md with accurate criterion wording.

  <action>
In `.planning/ROADMAP.md`, find Phase 1's success criterion #5:

```
  5. System prevents context overflow by compressing historical content at multiple granularity levels
```

Replace with:

```
  5. System prevents context overflow by prioritized tier truncation (multi-level compression in Phase 3)
```

This is a text-only change. Do not modify any other content in the file.
  </action>
  <verify>
`grep "prioritized tier truncation" .planning/ROADMAP.md` returns the updated line.
  </verify>
  <done>
ROADMAP.md success criterion #5 accurately describes Phase 1's delivery (prioritized tier truncation) with a parenthetical noting multi-level compression is Phase 3 work.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. `grep "prioritized tier truncation" .planning/ROADMAP.md` matches
2. `grep "multiple granularity levels" .planning/ROADMAP.md` returns no matches (old wording removed)
3. No other changes to ROADMAP.md besides the criterion text
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Phase 1 success criterion #5 says "prioritized tier truncation" instead of "multiple granularity levels"
- Parenthetical "(multi-level compression in Phase 3)" notes where the fuller implementation lives
- No other ROADMAP.md content changed
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-foundation-context-engine/01-08-SUMMARY.md`
